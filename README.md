Data required to generate plots from Mesoscale modeling manuscript submitted to Advanced Energy Materials 

The panels of Figure 8 are created from the text files: AMX2_sine_fourier_constants_compiled.txt and AMX2_cosine_fourier_constants_compiled.txt (where AMX2 corresponds to the material of interest). Data in these text files are structured as (Constant, n value, m value). The Constant value is in units of mJ/m^2. 

The two layer model of section V is implemented in theta_dep_diffusion_implicit.py
