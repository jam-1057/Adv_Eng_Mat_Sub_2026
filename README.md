Data required to generate plots from Mesoscale modeling manuscript submitted to Adv. Energy Mat. 

Figure 8 figures are created from AMX2_sine_fourier_constants_compiled.txt and AMX2_cosine_fourier_constants_compiled.txt. Data is structured as (Constant, n value, m value). The Constant value is in mJ/m^2. 

The two layer model of section V is implemented in implicit_theta.py
